### Project Title
**Investigate a dataset: Gapminder**

### Description
I used python's data analysis libraries (pandas; numpy; matplotlib) to analyse the Gapminder data set which contains economic and development indicators for which I communicated my findings around.
Going through the data analysis process gave me insight into the data wrangling, cleaning and visualisation stages.
I utilised my analysis entirely around descriptive rather than inferential statistics.
