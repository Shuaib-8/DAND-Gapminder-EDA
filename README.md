### Project Title
**Investigate a dataset: Gapminder**

### Description
I used python's data analysis libraries (pandas; numpy; matplotlib) to analyse the Gapminder data set which contains economic and development indicators for which I communicated my findings around.
Going through the data analysis process gave me insight into the data wrangling, cleaning and visualisation stages.
I utilised my analysis entirely around descriptive rather than inferential statistics.

#### Datasets
I choose datasets that expressed the following indicators (latest up to 2017):
<br>
* `GDP per capita (income_pc)`
* `Life expectancy (life_exp)`
* `Exports (% of GDP)`
* `Investment (% of GDP)`
<br>
Before any cleaning, they arrived in this format:
<br>
Country | Year 1 | Year 2 | Year 3... |
------------ | indicator value* | * | *... |
<br>
The years studied in this Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) were 1960-2017.
